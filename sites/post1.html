        <h2>Living with pet birds</h2>
        <p>I grew up with pets. When I was born, my parents had a cat. Unfortunately, she died quite soon after my
          birth. When I was about one year old, I got my first "own" pet, a bunny, which I had until I was nine. Over
          these years, we also had several birds (zebra finches, canaries and a budgie), an aquarium and a couple of
          guinea pigs. For 15 years after that, we had 4 cats, who became kind of my best friends.</p>

        <p>Taking this into consideration, it was really no surprise to my mom that I felt the urge to get pets very
          soon after moving out. It wasn't a sudden decision at all - I had been thinking about it several months before
          I got my first own apartment. After having settled in, I got back to the thought of what kind of pets I wanted
          to share my home with. I ended up settling with budgies - I always loved the chatter and singing from them.
          They ure would breathe new life into the apartment where I lived on my own. Plus, since we've had birds for
          several years before and I always was involved in taking care of them, I already had a little bit of
          experience.</p>

        <p>Around two weeks after that, in August 2017, my mom and me went to a local breeder and I got home with my
          first two budgies - Crash and Coco. At first, they were quite intimidated. Of course they had to get used to
          their new environment. They quickly settled in and I could let them roam in my living room. Coco and Crash
          quickly bonded and became a couple, grooming and feeding eachother. Sadly, Coco died a few months after
          getting them - in January 2018.</p>

        <p>I didn't want Crash to be alone, as budgies are swarm birds and need company. So I looked around for breeders
          to get him some company. Near my workplace I found one and Lemona, Cloud and Shy moved in to keep Crash
          company while I was at work or some other place. They got along great and I think it really helped Crash get
          over the loss of his beloved mate.</p>

        <p>After a couple of months, I realised that Shy was not a female as we all thought, as his cere turned a
          vibrant blue color over time. So it turned out I had 3 males and one female, which is not ideal at all. I
          thought long and hard about giving away one of the males or if I could fit two more females. Since I had
          gotten a bigger cage and they were free to fly around in my living room at all times except at night or when I
          was away, I decided I could give it a shot and get two more birds. This is how Sora and Flocke - German for
          (snow)flake - moved in.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I ended up losing Cloud, Sora and, most recently, Crash, and getting two more females, Mimi
          and Ella. So now, I have 5 of them - one male, 4 females. They are great companions as they bring a lot of
          life in the house and are a lot of fun to watch while they fly around and discover all the nooks and crannies
          in my new apartment. They are great climbers and enjoy climbing up and down on my curtains.</p>
